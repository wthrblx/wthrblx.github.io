# Can I submit my EToH towers? Will WTH add support for EToH towers?

Welcome To Hell will never support Eternal Towers of Hell and will only support the Welcome To Hell Kit.
 
Even if we are capable, we do not want to depend on and maintain EToH V6 or other kits. We want Welcome To Hell's identity to stand out from EToH.

We are unsure about continuations (ie. sequels) of EToH towers being built for Welcome To Hell, although we are leaning towards banning continuations. We will clarify this by the kit's initial release.

# Can I use assets from the Welcome To Hell Kit for my own games?

If you're building a tower for Welcome To Hell, sure.

If you're building a fangame of Welcome To Hell (ie. it is set in Caelum), sure.

If you are Eternal Towers of Hell, or are building a fangame of Eternal Towers of Hell, no. We would like the game's identity to stand out from Eternal Towers of Hell.

If you would like to use your WTH tower in your own projects not deriative of WTH, you must remove all WTH assets. This includes the kit.

Otherwise, please contact Team Fireworks for licensing.

# Will Welcome To Hell be free to play?

Yes

Welcome To Hell will be free at launch and indefinitely, and we will not monetize Welcome To Hell. Funding for Welcome To Hell will come from other projects and donations.

# AI?

AI-generated content is prohibited. We believe the ethical and environmental implications of AI far outweigh it's benefits, and we prefer Welcome To Hell to be human made.

We do not consent to our content being used for training AI.

# Can I use your soundtrack?

We are currently drafting soundtrack licensing, which you can find on our [wthrblx/legal] repository.

To summarize:

- You can use the OST to promote Welcome To Hell, ie:
    - Gameplay videos
    - Edits and compilations
    - Remixes, covers, and the like
- We will require attribution
- Don’t resell, redistribute, or claim ownership of the OST
